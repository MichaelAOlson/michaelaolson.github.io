## Spooky Professionalism

Happy Halloween ghosts and ghouls!

Leading up to the day of scares and fright, I gradually ordered peices of a costume with a general "gothic" theme. An all-black cloak with a large hood, pants with straps and buckles, and a black mask. While not always the case, this particular costume hardly spent any time in my frontal cortex before I started purchasing.

So today was the day - I donned my garb and eagerly awaited the daily stand-up meeting with my 10-person team. To my surprise, not a single person dressed up for the day, nor did they plan to dress up later that night. I don't blame them for not wanting to work in a costume all day, and my costume was well recieved, but it does make you wonder about the pressure of *being professional*. 

I wish to use this story to encourage **you**, dear reader, to live genuinely.

As a corollary to the general [radical candor](https://www.radicalcandor.com/) framework of caring genuinely and being open and honest, I suggest breathing life into your professional relationships with real personality. Even as an introvert, Halloween presents a unique opportunity to show your colleagues a bit more about your interests through costume, and you may find others who like the same. Rise above the cold relationships of business and form bonds with the humans who join you as colleagues.

Now go forth and live, but don't forget to come back and read some posts sometimes.
