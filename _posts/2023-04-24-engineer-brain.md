# Engineer Brain
Some years ago I convinced a bunch of my family to use [Signal](https://signal.org/) for encrypted messaging. This has been great - it can be sent over wifi rather than cell towers, it supported modern messaging features like replies, reactions, rich previews, and more, and if you're texting someone who is not using Signal, it behaves as a normal SMS/MMS app. Fantastic.

Fast forward - the non-profit entity developing and maintaining Signal announced that they were [removing SMS support](https://signal.org/blog/sms-removal-android/). I have mixed feelings about this. I understand and support the philosophy, but now I have to explain to non-tech savvy people why they have to use two apps for messaging. This alone could be a nightmare worth ranting about, but it is not what I am here to write about.

My wife once used the term "engineer brain" to describe what I focus on and respond to in conversation. While I enjoy exploring deeper topics and heavy discussion, this can slow down an interaction. Of course, adapting to others' responses and body language is all part of successful communication - I just naturally click with those who are happy to dive in on a topic for a while. 

As a tech enthusiast (or perhaps more accurately just "engineer-brained"), I generally enjoy understanding how things work. I love knowing that power lines use high voltages because they experience less power loss over long distances. It is fascinating that Bluetooth 5.0+ manages to achieve further range and higher bandwidth than previous versions while using less power. When Signal drops SMS support and I am asked such questions as, "is normal texting safe?", my engineer brain wants to explain every little detail about how texting works so they can decide for themselves.

Unfortunately for me, all they really want to hear is "no", and **this is perfectly ok**.

I have since spent an hour reading texting protocol specifications and will probably just internalize them forever. No one really cares as long as it works.
